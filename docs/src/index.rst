Welcome to Solverz's documentation!
-----------------------------------

.. A `PDF version of these docs <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/releases>`_ is also available.

`Solverz <https://github.com/rzyu45/Solverz>`_ is a Python-based, open-source simulation modeling language. It supports
models based on partial differential equations (PDEs), ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and algebraic equations (AEs).
And a diverse set of mature simulation algorithms are provided to solve these models.
What's more, Solverz also grants you the freedom to design and compare your tailored algorithms through the provided numerical/symbolic interfaces.

If you are new to Solverz, start with the :ref:`introductory tutorial <intro-tutorial>`.

This is the central page for all of Solverz's documentation.
